   <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>As an ambitious IBDP student at II. gimnazija Maribor, I am passionately pursuing my academic journey with a foucus on Math AA HL, Physics HL, Macedonian A HL and English B HL. Alongside these subjects, I also take Economics SL and Chemistry SL, broadening my knowledge base and honing my analytical skills. Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively participate in various extracurricular activities to enhance my skills and contribute to my community. <br/> As a member of the coding club, I continuously develop my programming skills, seeking innovative solutions. Additionally, my involvement in Model United Nations (MUN) and Interact Club has nurtured my leadership skills and global perspective. Volunteering holds a special place in my heart, allowing me to give back to society and make a positive impact on the lives of others. Engaging in volunteer initiatives, I have developed empathy, teamwork, and a strong sense of social responsibility.</p>
    <p>Driven by a profound interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am actively working towards a career that combines my passion for technology and problem-solving. I believe that AI and ML have the potential to revolutionize industries and reshape the way we live and work. <br/> With a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and programming, I am eager to explore the applications of AI and ML in solving complex problems. My goal is to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that optimize processes, drive innovation, and improve the lives of individuals and communities.</p>
